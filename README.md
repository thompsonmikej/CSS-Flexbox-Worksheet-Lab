# CSS-Flexbox-Worksheet-Lab

**Developed at devCodeCamp**

A hands-on exercise focused on mastering CSS Flexbox for positioning and aligning multiple items relative to each other within a modern, responsive layout.

---

## Description

This lab provides practical experience using **CSS Flexbox** to arrange and position designated elements within a web page. By leveraging Flexbox’s one-dimensional layout model, you can easily control alignment, spacing, and distribution of items in a container—even as the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

---

## Features

- Position and align multiple items horizontally or vertically using Flexbox.
- Responsive layouts without floats, manual margins, or complex positioning.
- Master `justify-content`, `align-items`, and other key Flexbox properties for fine-tuned control.
- Practice with semantic HTML5 structure for accessibility and maintainability.

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 (with semantic elements)
- CSS3 (Flexbox)

## Usage

- Modify the `style.css` to experiment with different Flexbox properties.

## Future Improvements

- Add more advanced Flexbox examples (nested flex containers, wrapping, and responsive design tweaks).
- Include annotated code snippets and visual diagrams for reference.
- Compare Flexbox with CSS Grid to highlight when to use each layout model.
